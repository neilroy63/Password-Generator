# Password-Generator

# Overview

The architecture was relatively simple as I was given an existing codebase to work with.

The challenge was to modify starter code to create an application that enabled employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that they'd selected. The application was to run in the browser and had to feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I had written. It was to have a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapted to multiple screen sizes.

The resultant password, besides including lowercase, uppercase and numbers, could also include special characters. Crucially, the password length had to be between 8 and 128 characters. 

# Design Decision(s)

I elected to declare my own variables with strings of the available characters that would then respond to user input and feed the password function(s). 

I modified the CSS styling slightly to give the application a more soothing color theme.  

# Issues

I encountered slight issues with specifying the required variables for the resultant password string, that I was eventually able to resolve ensuring that the application ran as expected.

# Assumptions

User would be content with a password length of anywhere between 8 and 128 characters.
